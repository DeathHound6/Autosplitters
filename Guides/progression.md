# EASY METHOD
1. Get the start address that can be found using the [start guide](start.md) 
2. Add 60 to that address in hexadecimal (use a calculator if necessary)
3. That's the progression address

    Example:

    7FFBDAE6AF20

    000000000060 +

    progression address:	7FFBDAE6AF80

# ALTERNATIVE METHOD (NOT SURE IF IT WORKS FOR EVERY VERSION, THIS IS FOR ENHANCED)
1. Load into a new save
2. Wait for waking up scene to end
3. Scan for value 36 with type 4 bytes
4. Follow the storyline till you meet the quartermaster
5. Before you talk to the quartermaster scan for 54
6. You should end up with only one green address, copy that to your list
   1. In case you didn't get one green address, restart from step 1
7. Grab the full address from that and use it in the autosplitter
