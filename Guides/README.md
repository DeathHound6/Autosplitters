# README
These are a couple of guides to be used for when I'm not around to update the files when the game updates.
Sadly when new content is added it tends to break the addresses I've found.

YOU WILL NEED CHEAT ENGINE FOR THIS!

**MAKE SURE TO DISABLE VAC SECURITY IN THE SETTINGS!**

## GUIDES
* [Start guide](start.md): used in the autostartnloadless
* [Progression guide](progression.md): used in the autosplitter
